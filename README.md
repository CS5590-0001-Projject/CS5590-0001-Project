 ### The data and its details

 In this project I use the Labeled Faces in the Wild Dataset[1] as our training and testing dataset. This is a face photo database designed for studying the problem of face recognition in the natural environment. The dataset contains more than 13,000 images collected from the Internet. Each face is marked with the person’s name. This dataset contains a total 5749 person’s photos, of which 1,680 people have two or more different photos, which are captured by the Viola-Jones face detector. 

 Given that the ideal application scenario of this model is the company's commuting records and the pursuit of suspects by the public security organs, the input should come from real life. For the company, the input photos of the model may be taken in the office building. For public security organs, the pictures are more from roads, shopping malls and other public places.
